# Web App for "Aasha"

"Aasha" is a key for early detection of Breast Cancer. It is a product from Sahyadri Samyama Tech LLP led by a team of 4 engineers envisioning to eradicate the difficultly to identify breast tumors using thermography.

### :one: Introduction
**This repository is just the source code of the web application for Aasha (It has nothing to do with the patentable/noval proposed solution)**. Aasha is an innovative product that detects breast cancer at an early stage and decreases mortality rate by 60% using thermal imaging. This web app is used to save the patient details, read and save thermal images and to generate the report of the preliminary diagnostics.

### :two: What problem is Aasha solving?
The problem that Aasha trying to tackle is believed to be most prevalent in Indian women. It is estimated that 1 in 28 women are likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer once in their lifetime, and because this form of cancer is generally detected late, medication can save only 1 out of the 2 patients. Studies have also proven that there is a wide disparity in mortality rates of women living in rural and urban regions, where every 4 minutes 1 woman is diagnosed but every 13 minutes 1 woman loses her life, this means that every year about 80,000 to 1 lakh women lose their battle against breast cancer.

### :three: Whats the solution?
So is there any solution to this? A solution such that it reaches every society, every community and serves every woman? Well, that's where Aasha comes in! The proposed solution "Aasha" is a preliminary diagnostic technique for early detection of Breast cancer. It is a portable device that's noninvasive, painless, and radiation free. It equips ML Algorithms for better accuracy and test report generation. This product is trying to tackle one of the characteristics of the cancerous tumor - i.e.,  Angiogenesis - the property of giving out minute heat gradients. So, by training our model with alot of thermal data we would be able detect the presence of cancerous cells or any other malfunction even in the women under the age of 40.

### :four: How will Aasha be implemented?
Aasha is an infrastructure setup, that can be either taken to rural or remote areas in mobile vans or could be set up in any healthcare centers. The implementation architecture, revolves around setting up thermal cameras to detect heat gradients, and then going ahead to the infrastructure setup in rural or urban health centers wherein in the trained technician could use the technology for taking thermal images of the patient and then upload it to our platform to get a quick breast health report.

### :four: Conclusion
Remember that there can be a life after breast cancer. The prerequisite is early detection. So, through Aasha, the team looks forward to support the fighters, admire the survivors, honor the taken, and never give up hope.
